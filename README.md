Siamese neural network with contrastive loss.

The main.py file contains the the training loop. Scripts in the module folders contain the data pair-making logic, the preprocessing pipeline, the data generator, and the model architecture.

It is recommended to run the file piece by piece in a Jupyter notebook instead of running the entire file.
